# 🌞 SolarBot – Autonomous Solar Panel Cleaning Robot  

## 📌 Overview  
SolarBot is an autonomous robot developed as a graduation project at An-Najah National University.  
It is designed to clean solar panels automatically, maintaining their efficiency and preventing dust and dirt accumulation that can reduce energy output by up to 20–30%.  

🔹 Uses a motorized brush with a water pump  
🔹 Equipped with ultrasonic sensors + MPU for obstacle and edge detection  
🔹 Controlled through a web application via Wi-Fi  
🔹 Supports multiple operation modes:  
- **Auto Mode** – fully autonomous cleaning  
- **Timed Mode** – scheduled cleaning using RTC  
- **Manual Mode** – real-time remote control
